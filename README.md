# Airbnb_DataBase_SQL_Python_Streamlit
A StreamLit frontend and DataBase project using Postgresql, SQL, and Python
 AirBnb Database System Project Description

While battling against Covid-19, the world is gradually opening up for tourism. Having memorable trips through AirBnb is getting increasingly popular among people around the world. Airbnb does not only provide affordable trips but also connects the world together through cordial hosts and unique listings. This application is meant to create a database system for AirBnb hosts and rentals and other relevant entities. The users of this application can be data scientists who are interested in what kind of hosts and listings are active on this website, or prospective customers who intend to book some rooms to stay for leisure or business trips. All the data is made up, but I borrow countless inspirations from the actual dataset by AirBnb. The entities’ attributes and the entities’ relationships are closely modeling what is happening in the real world with AirBnb. I use my own personal experience booking AirBnb services in the past and policies provided on AirBnb website and published data (cited below) to model the entity sets and relationships. 

Entities, relationship sets, and business rules are in the report.pdf, SQL codes are in data, Python frontend codes are in project.py.
